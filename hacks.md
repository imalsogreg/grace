# Hacks done in the tech demo

These need to be fixed before we can say we're working on a product.

 - CORS needs to be disabled for grace-browser to work
 - `Normalize` gets passed type info
 - Calls `loadContext` over and over again.
 - Image/toTensor requires that `@[1,1,28,28]` syntax - can we fix this through type inference?
 - Image/fromTensor requires that `@[1,1,28,28]` syntax - can we fix this through type inference?
 - Using a special branch of octo-cli that supports multi-model packages
